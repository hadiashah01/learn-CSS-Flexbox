# Introduction
This challenge focuses on building the structural skeleton of a complex UI layout using **nested Flexbox containers**. The goal was to move beyond simple rows and columns to understand how real-world website sections are layered.

# Purpose of This Challenge

The primary objectives of this specific task were:

- **Mastering Nesting:** Placing flex containers inside other flex containers to create complex layouts.

- **Flex Ratios** Using `flex-grow` to distribute space proportionally across three main columns.

- **Axis Control:** Managing the switch between `flex-direction: row` (for columns) and `flex-direction: column` (for stacked items).

- **Alignment Precision:** Using `justify-content` and `align-items` for specific box placement.
