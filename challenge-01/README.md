# Introduction
This challenge focuses on building the structural skeleton of a complex UI layout using **nested Flexbox containers**. The goal was to move beyond simple rows and columns to understand how real-world website sections are layered.

# Purpose of This Challenge

The primary objectives of this specific task were:

- **Mastering Nesting:** Placing flex containers inside other flex containers to create complex layouts.

- **Flex Ratios** Using `flex-grow` to distribute space proportionally across three main columns.

- **Axis Control:** Managing the switch between `flex-direction: row` (for columns) and `flex-direction: column` (for stacked items).

- **Alignment Precision:** Using `justify-content` and `align-items` for specific box placement.

# Topics & Techniques Applied

- **Flexbox Architecture:** Using a parent `.outer` wrapper to manage the entire layout.

- **Proportional Scaling:** Implementing `flex-grow` (values of 0.5, 10, and 14) to control column widths.

- **CSS Variables:** Utilizing `--box-size` and `--gap-around` for maintainable and consistent spacing.

- **Visual Debugging:** Using color-coded borders (red, blue, green, purple) to verify nesting boundaries.

- **Viewport Units:** Applying `vh` (viewport height) to ensure the structure fills the browser screen.

**NOTES:**

- This challenge is strictly focused on **layout logic** and **structural integrity**.

- No external frameworks or JavaScript were used; created strictly with vanilla HTML and CSS.
