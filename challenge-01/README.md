# Purpose of This Challenge

The primary objectives of this specific task were:

- **`Mastering Nesting:`** Placing flex containers inside other flex containers to create complex layouts.

- **`Flex Ratios:`** Using `flex-grow` to distribute space proportionally across three main columns.

-**` Axis Control:`** Managing the switch between `flex-direction: row` (for columns) and `flex-direction: column` (for stacked items).

- **`Alignment Precision:`** Using `justify-content` and `align-items` for specific box placement.
